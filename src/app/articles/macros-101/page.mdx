If you’re a high-performing CEO, entrepreneur, or parent, your time is your most valuable asset. You know the value of efficiency in business—but when it comes to nutrition, most people are still running outdated software.

Enter: macros.
Protein, carbs, and fats.
The three levers you can pull to completely change your body composition, energy, and performance.

Think of them as your profit and loss statement for health. If you don’t understand them, you’re flying blind.

## Protein: The Builder

Protein is the cornerstone of performance nutrition. It’s what your body uses to build and repair muscle tissue, support immune function, and keep you satiated.

- **Calories per gram:** 4  
- **Goal intake:** 0.8–1.2g per pound of body weight (closer to 1g for simplicity)  
- **Best sources:** chicken, beef, fish, Greek yogurt, whey protein, tofu, lentils  

For busy professionals, protein is your insurance policy. Hit this first, and you’re already 70% of the way there.

## Carbohydrates: The Fuel

Carbs often get demonized, but they’re your body’s preferred source of energy—especially for your brain and during training.

- **Calories per gram:** 4

- **Role:** replenish glycogen (fuel storage), stabilize energy, improve recovery

- **Best sources:** rice, oats, potatoes, fruit, whole grain bread, legumes

For entrepreneurs and executives, carbs are your “mental fuel.” Ever notice brain fog during low-carb diets? That’s your body asking for glucose.

A practical target: 35–50% of your daily calories from carbs, scaled up or down based on activity.


## Fats: The Hormone Regulator

Fats are essential—not just “allowed.” They help regulate hormones, absorb vitamins, and keep you feeling satisfied.

- **Calories per gram:** 9

- **Role:** hormone health (think testosterone, estrogen, cortisol), brain function, joint health

- **Best sources:** olive oil, avocado, salmon, nuts, eggs, dark chocolate

For high performers, cutting fats too low can tank energy and mood. Aiming for 20–30% of calories from fats is a good baseline.


## Putting It Together: The Macro Equation

Here’s a simple framework for a 2,000-calorie example:

- **Protein:** 160g (640 calories → 32%)

- **Carbs:** 220g (880 calories → 44%)

- **Fats:** 55g (495 calories → 24%)

Adjust the percentages, not the rules. Protein stays steady, carbs and fats flex based on your lifestyle and training.

## Why This Matters for You

Just like your business, your body thrives on systems. Tracking macros is like reviewing financial statements: you see exactly what’s coming in and how it impacts performance.

- Want to lose fat? Run a calorie deficit while keeping protein high.

- Want to build muscle? Run a calorie surplus, fueled by carbs and protein.

- Want to simply perform at your best every day? Keep your macros balanced, consistent, and aligned with your goals.

Stop guessing. Start measuring. That’s how you scale not just your business, but your health, your energy, and your longevity.

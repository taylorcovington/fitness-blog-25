I’ll never forget sitting at the kitchen table with my wife years ago, both of us feeling frustrated.

We weren’t out of shape, but we weren’t feeling great either. We were juggling three kids, running businesses, working late, trying to be present parents, and somewhere in between, wondering why we felt so drained all the time. I remember saying something like, *“I just want to be healthier. I don’t need a six-pack - I just want more energy, better sleep, and to not feel like I need three cups of coffee to survive the day.”*

That conversation became the foundation of everything we now teach inside our coaching program.

Because getting healthier doesn’t start with a complicated spreadsheet of macros or some intense detox. It starts with nailing the basics.

So if you’re in that same boat—feeling like you just want to *feel better* and maybe lose some weight along the way - this post is for you.

Let’s talk about the **real basics** of health and nutrition.


## 1. Fat Loss = Calorie Deficit

Let’s just get this one out of the way: if you want to lose fat, you need to eat fewer calories than your body burns.

There’s no way around this. Keto, intermittent fasting, paleo, clean eating—they all “work” because they help people eat fewer calories. That’s it.

If you want your body to start using stored fat for energy, it needs a reason to do so. That reason is a **calorie deficit**.

Now, we *don’t* want you starving yourself. That’s why we focus on the next key…


## 2. Eat More Protein Than You Think You Need

Protein is the real MVP.

When you’re eating in a calorie deficit, **protein keeps you full**, **helps protect your muscle**, and **burns more calories during digestion** compared to fats and carbs.

A good rule of thumb? Aim for **0.8–1g of protein per pound of body weight**.

So if you weigh 180 lbs, try to eat around 150–180g of protein per day.

That might sound like a lot at first, but you’ll be amazed at how much better you feel when you make protein a priority. Less hunger. Better energy. More stable blood sugar. And if you’re training (which I recommend—more on that in a second), it helps you **build or maintain lean muscle**.


## 3. Water > Everything Else

Most of us walk around dehydrated, and we wonder why we’re tired, cranky, or hungry.

Here’s a simple rule: **Drink half your body weight in ounces of water every day.**

So again, if you weigh 180 lbs, shoot for 90 oz of water.

Buy a big water bottle. Keep it with you. Refill it often. Hydration improves your digestion, energy, mood, and even performance in the gym.


## 4. Move Your Body - Every Day

I get it - you’re busy. Me too.

But if there’s one thing that has kept me sane through long workdays, coaching soccer practice, and building businesses, it’s this:

**Get 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day.**

That’s it. Don’t overthink it.

Walk in the morning. Walk after meals. Take phone calls while walking. Park farther away. Chase your kids around.

Daily movement helps with fat loss, digestion, blood sugar regulation, and mental clarity. It’s simple. It’s free. And it works.

## 5. Strength Train 2–4x Per Week

No, you don’t have to be a bodybuilder. But lifting weights 2–4 times a week will change your life.

Why? Because:

- It **builds muscle** (which helps you burn more calories at rest)
- It **improves your strength and mobility** (which matters more as you get older)
- It **boosts confidence** like nothing else

You don’t need a fancy gym. Bodyweight workouts, dumbbells, kettlebells—whatever you have access to, just **start**.


## 6. Sleep Like It’s Your Job

This one is hard, especially with kids (trust me, I know). But **sleep is where your body recovers and regulates everything** - hormones, hunger, mood, energy.

Start by getting 7–8 hours per night consistently. If you’re not there yet, aim to get just 30 more minutes than you’re currently getting. It adds up.

Cut screens 30 minutes before bed, keep your room cool, and try to stick to a consistent sleep/wake schedule.


## 7. Lower Stress (Even a Little Bit)

Stress isn’t just a mental issue - it’s physical too. High stress raises cortisol, which can mess with fat loss, sleep, cravings, and recovery.

You don’t need a 90-minute meditation practice. Just find **small ways to breathe and slow down**:

- Walk without your phone  
- Journal or brain dump at night  
- Take 5 deep breaths when your brain is spinning  

Every little bit helps.


## Putting It All Together

If this feels like a lot, don’t worry—you don’t need to do everything perfectly from Day 1.

Start here:

✅ Eat more protein  
✅ Drink more water  
✅ Go for a walk  
✅ Get some sleep

Build momentum. Stack small wins.

That’s what we do inside our coaching. We help busy people create simple, sustainable routines—ones that actually *fit their life.*

Because when you build your health on habits (not hacks), the results stick.

You’ve got this.

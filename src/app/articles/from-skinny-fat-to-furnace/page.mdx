I used to live in the cycle.  

The one where you cut calories as low as possible, run yourself into the ground with cardio, and pray the scale finally drops.  

It works… until it doesn’t.  

A few weeks of progress, then the hunger sets in, the energy crashes, and eventually the cravings take over. You “fall off,” gain the weight back, and tell yourself you’ll try harder next time.  

I spent years in that loop.  

At 165 pounds, I wasn’t overweight. But I wasn’t lean either. The mirror showed someone stuck in the middle — skinny arms, soft stomach. The dreaded *skinny fat*.  

No matter how hard I dieted or how much cardio I did, nothing changed. The weight came off temporarily, but my body never looked the way I wanted it to. And worse, it never stayed off.  

Then I realized something that shifted everything:  

I didn’t need to lose more weight.  
I needed to **build muscle**.  


Muscle is expensive tissue.  
It costs your body calories just to maintain.  

The more muscle you have, the more you become a furnace — burning energy even when you’re sitting still. That’s why people who strength train can eat more food, stay leaner, and avoid the endless yo-yo cycle of cutting and regaining.  

I started focusing less on *losing* and more on *building*.  
Less cardio. More weights.  
Less obsession with the scale. More obsession with strength.  

Fast forward to today - I’m 180 pounds, leaner than I’ve ever been, and I finally have the six-pack I was chasing all those years.  

The secret wasn’t starving myself.  
It was building something worth fueling.  


If you’re stuck in that same loop, here’s what I wish I knew earlier:  

- **Lifting weights beats endless cardio.** Cardio has its place, but it won’t build the body you want.  
- **Protein is your best friend.** Aim for at least 0.8–1g per pound of bodyweight daily.  
- **Stop chasing “less.”** Build more muscle, and the fat takes care of itself.  
- **Play the long game.** Building muscle is slower than losing fat — but it lasts.  

The cycle ends when you flip the script.  
Stop trying to get smaller.  
Start trying to get stronger.
